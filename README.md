# About
After another completed course module, I was given another task to complete. I am happy to present my next completed project. This is a very simple interactive task list that allows you to add your own task content in a form field, which will then be displayed. Each task you add can be marked as completed, unmarked again or deleted.

**Main features**:

- Ability to add custom task content
- Ability to delete or change the status of a task to completed or not completed
- No ability to edit added tasks. Functionality as well as the appearance of the application itself is a result of the exact instructions according to which it was to be created by me and the criteria by which it will be evaluated.

## 🤔 Solutions provided in the project

As I mentioned earlier, the goal of the project was to create an app that would work and look just like the one presented by my Mentor. This was the first project where we were not expected to create something according to our own vision. Creativity was also important here, but it wasn't to be manifested in the way we styled our site, but what solutions we would use to achieve a particular effect. Using all the knowledge I gained from the course, I tried to recreate the site that was presented to me and which was my only inspiration in this case. Of course, it should be mentioned that I did not have access to its code.


## 💭 Conclusions for future projects

To my surprise, introducing all the functionality using JavaScript did not cause me much difficulty this time. I had quite a bit of trouble in placing objects such as buttons in my form. It turned out that despite many hours of practice I still have a problem with using flex and grid tools in practice. Despite the fact that I understand their use and have practiced using them while playing browser games such as flexbox zombies and flexbox froggy without much difficulty, this project made me realize that I still need to work on this area. 

## ✅ Project Status


Project is: under evaluation... 📝

Given that my task was to "copy" the page there is a pretty good chance that I did something differently or could have used better solutions. After feedback, the page will be edited and some changes will be made.
